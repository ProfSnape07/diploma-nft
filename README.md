# Diploma as an ERC-721 NFT

<p align="justify">
    In the contemporary digital era, the verification of a candidate's academic qualifications can prove to be tedious
    and prolonged work for organisations. The conventional method of verifying diplomas, which entails contacting the
    educational institution or physically examining the diploma, can require several days or even weeks to complete. The
    process of verifying the qualifications of multiple candidates can be excessively time-consuming for employers. <br>
    The traditional approach to diploma validation may be deemed unreliable, as well as susceptible to instances of
    fraud and forgery. The authenticity of a diploma is often called into question due to the prevalence of fraudulent
    copies, or the inability of the issuing educational institution to provide the necessary documentation for
    verification purposes.

    Note: While details are being fetched from the blockchain every time someone searches for any diploma, the image of
    the diploma hasn't been stored on the blockchain but its link. Images are just a cosmetic layer for this project
    which currently have been stored using a centralised cloud storage but it can also be stored in a decentralised way
    using <i>IPFS.</i><br>
    Although the image may be appealing to the non-techie fellow, the source of truth must always be the blockchain.
