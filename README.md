In the contemporary digital era, the verification of a candidate's academic qualifications can
prove to be tedious and prolonged work for organisations. The conventional method of
verifying diplomas, which entails contacting the educational institution or physically
examining the diploma, can require several days or even weeks to complete. The process of
verifying the qualifications of multiple candidates can be excessively time-consuming for
employers. <br>
The traditional approach to diploma validation may be deemed unreliable, as well as
susceptible to instances of fraud and forgery. The authenticity of a diploma is often called into
question due to the prevalence of fraudulent copies, or the inability of the issuing educational
institution to provide the necessary documentation for verification purposes.
